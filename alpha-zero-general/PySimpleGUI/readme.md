### PySimpleGUI

This folder contains the GUI from [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that I use here to play against the network using a GUI in `../playnet.py` (which is adapted from [PySimpleGUI's chess demo](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/Chess))
