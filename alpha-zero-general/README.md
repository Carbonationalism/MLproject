# Alpha Zero General (Halfchess)

This folder contains a trimmed and modified version of the [alpha-zero-general repository](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) (see below) that has been adapted to work with "halfchess". There's a link to download a pretrained network in the `pretrained_models/` directory. 

# Alpha Zero General (any game, any framework!)

A simplified, highly flexible, commented and (hopefully) easy to understand implementation of self-play based reinforcement learning based on the AlphaGo Zero paper (Silver et al). It is designed to be easy to adopt for any two-player turn-based adversarial game and any deep learning framework of your choice. A sample implementation has been provided for the game of Othello in PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow and Chainer. An accompanying tutorial can be found [here](http://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html). We also have implementations for GoBang and TicTacToe.
